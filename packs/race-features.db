Divided into 6 clans (of which 5 are playable, the 6th being the royal clan and very small), each clan has specialized the training of its members. Each clan includes members of all elemental heritages (as that is an individual trait, not a family one).</p><p>Physically, dragonborn are scaled-skin humanoids standing taller than most humans (5’6” to 6’2”). They stand upright but have lizard-like tails, and their scales are different colors depending on which element their souls resonate with. While appearing reptilian, they are still mammalian, bearing live young and nursing them just like the humans they originated from. Their skins, while not as tough as the scales of dragons, are relatively insensitive and tough and so they often wear fewer clothes for incidental protection. They still wear armor as normal, with custom-made boots that leave their clawed toes free. They have hair or feather-like crests and/or horns or leathery crests.</p><p>Names: By convention, all dragonborn use names following the pattern [Given] [Status] [Clan]. The clans are described above, and the status marker is either ka for nobles or vo for the common folk.</p><p>Common male dragonborn names include: Aodh, Arthfael, Caderyn, Caomh, Cynbel, Cynwrig, Drustan, Judoc, Maedoc, Nechtan, and Seisyll. Common female dragonborn names include: Abi, Ailsa, Beathag, Catrina, Beitris, Elspeth, Fiona, Iona, Isobel, Jean, Kenna, Lilias, Mhairi, Morven, Seona, Sheona, and Una.</p><p>Ability Score Increase. Either your Dexterity or Strength score (your choice) increases by 2.</p><p>Age. Dragonborn live about the same as humans, although the rigors of their lives mean many do not die of natural causes.</p><p>Size. Dragonborn are taller than most humans, standing between 5’8” and 6’6” and averaging between 200 and 250 lbs. Females are slightly larger on average than males. Your size is Medium.</p><p>Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p>Draconic Ancestry. See PHB table.</p><p>Breath Weapon. You can use your bonus action to exhale destructive energy in a 15' cone. Your draconic ancestry determines the damage type of the exhalation.</p><p>When you use your breath weapon, each creature must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</p><p>After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p><p>Damage Resistance. You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.</p><p>Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.</p><p></p><p><strong>Colors | Damage Type | Save</strong></p><p>Blue | Lightning  | Dex</p><p>Green, Copper | Acid | Dex</p><p>Red, Bronze | Fire  | Dex</p><p>White, Silver | Cold  | Con</p><p>Brass | Thunder  | Con</p><p>Black | Necrotic | Con</p><p>Gold | Radiant | Dex</p><p></p><p>Clan Syra</p><p>Syra are mostly farmers and herdsmen on the plains below the Kairen Mountains.

Cursed by blood-rage and stigmatized as savages for centuries, they fought for the Army of Darkness at the Cataclysm. In the aftermath of the Battle of Acceptance, some kept to their brutal ways; others chose a new path. About 40 years ago, a powerful shaman of the Skem tribe had a vision in which a chilling frost spread out of the Kairen Mountains and covered the land. In this vision, she saw that the only path to the preservation of her people was for them (and other tribes) to join the struggling Remnant Dynasty in their losing battle against the Hungering Frost. Four tribes (including her own Skem) accepted the call of duty.</p><p>In the following decades, the orcs of the Kard, Ko, Skem, and Tabar tribes have become a major part of Wyrmhold’s strength. The ferocity and military power of Tabar, the resource-gathering of Kard, the protection from raiders offered by Ko (as well as the artifacts recovered from pre-Cataclysm ruins), and the mystical power of Skem have given the dragonborn and goblin kingdom breathing room, leading to the current stabilization of the situation. Since the fall of the Frost, they have continued to strengthen the kingdom, although cracks are beginning to show in these peaceful times.</p><p>Not all orcs are from those tribes. Over to the east, across Lake Coy'in, some tribes have mingled (willingly or not) with the local humans of Dreamshore. While the tribes themselves are not part of the Duarchy of Kotimaa, half-breed children occasionally seek their human roots in the more settled lands. Another group of orcs in Godsfall were altered by demonic machinations--their reddened skin and enlarged tusks bear record of this alteration.</p><p>Physically, orcs are tall and bulky. They average between 5’5” and 6’6” and weigh between 180 and 240 lbs. Females are usually slightly slimmer than males, but just as tall and muscled. Their hair is usually dark brown or black and thick. Their skin has a light green-grey tint to it. They become more green when tanned. Almost all orcs have tattoos showing their clan affiliation. These start on the back of one hand (left for females, right for males) and continue up the arm. It is normal to keep that arm uncovered where possible. Their eyes are green, brown, or red.

Cursed by blood-rage and stigmatized as savages for centuries, they fought for the Army of Darkness at the Cataclysm. In the aftermath of the Battle of Acceptance, some kept to their brutal ways; others chose a new path. About 40 years ago, a powerful shaman of the Skem tribe had a vision in which a chilling frost spread out of the Kairen Mountains and covered the land. In this vision, she saw that the only path to the preservation of her people was for them (and other tribes) to join the struggling Remnant Dynasty in their losing battle against the Hungering Frost. Four tribes (including her own Skem) accepted the call of duty.</p><p>In the following decades, the orcs of the Kard, Ko, Skem, and Tabar tribes have become a major part of Wyrmhold’s strength. The ferocity and military power of Tabar, the resource-gathering of Kard, the protection from raiders offered by Ko (as well as the artifacts recovered from pre-Cataclysm ruins), and the mystical power of Skem have given the dragonborn and goblin kingdom breathing room, leading to the current stabilization of the situation. Since the fall of the Frost, they have continued to strengthen the kingdom, although cracks are beginning to show in these peaceful times.</p><p>Not all orcs are from those tribes. Over to the east, across Lake Coy'in, some tribes have mingled (willingly or not) with the local humans of Dreamshore. While the tribes themselves are not part of the Duarchy of Kotimaa, half-breed children occasionally seek their human roots in the more settled lands. Another group of orcs in Godsfall were altered by demonic machinations--their reddened skin and enlarged tusks bear record of this alteration.</p><p>Physically, orcs are tall and bulky. They average between 5’5” and 6’6” and weigh between 180 and 240 lbs. Females are usually slightly slimmer than males, but just as tall and muscled. Their hair is usually dark brown or black and thick. Their skin has a light green-grey tint to it. They become more green when tanned. Almost all orcs have tattoos showing their clan affiliation. These start on the back of one hand (left for females, right for males) and continue up the arm. It is normal to keep that arm uncovered where possible. Their eyes are green, brown, or red. When angry, all their eyes become visibly redder.</p><p>Names: Dynastic orcs use the name pattern &lt;Given&gt; gro'&lt;Clan&gt;. Common male given names include: Aban, Dalaigh, Devlin, Dochas, Beirgin, Flynn, Gearalt, Girvan, Cian, Conlan, Cormac, Paidin, Raghnall, Raighne, Rigr, Kellach, Ruairc, Ughaire, Ualtar, Ulick, and Ungus. Common female given names include: Abaigh, Aedamnair, Agata, Daighin, Dela, Ailis, Andraste, Ebhlin, Gerricm Gitta, Gleneen, Goibne, Hayley, Ilane, Ide, Ita, Irna, Radha, Keena, Keira, Una, and Uathach.</p><p>Ability Score Increase.

They call the Council Lands home. Their ancestors were refugees from many pre-Cataclysm nations, forced to flee south from the site of the Battle of Acceptance and from the massive changes in the landscape that happened at the Cataclysm. Gathering around a small settlement and a newly-founded mage school/temple, they have built a very communal, highly-ordered society. It is also the home of many other races--both kinds of elves, dwarves, halflings, and the rare infernal- and celestial-touched tieflings and aasimar. They are also the most devout of the human sub-races.</p><p>A unique trait of the wall-builders (and the source of their name) is that they cluster together wherever they build settlements and always construct at least a token wall around their villages, no matter how small. Even single houses, if possible, will have a hedge or fence or wall. They don’t feel safe without one, even if there is no threat. Another oddity due to the genetic bottle-neck of the Cataclysm is that many (but not all) wall-builders are highly allergic to bee stings. Thus, they rarely work as apiarists or tend orchards, leaving that to other races.</p><p>Physically, their skin is medium-brown and warm-toned (cafe-au-lait). Darker shades are more common than lighter ones, but neither is particularly uncommon. Their hair is dark brown to black and mostly wavy or curly. While this is the most common shade, throwbacks to other ethnicities are common and unremarkable--red hair, blond hair, etc. Only hardy individuals survived, and compactness meant less bulk to feed, so they are short and stocky in stature. They tend to stand 5'2\" to 5'6\" tall, with women as tall as men. Taller individuals are uncommon, with 6'0\" rarely reached by anyone. Obesity is becoming more common, especially among the wealthy. The fashion in attractiveness favors the well-fed and curved. Squared-off facial features with short noses and square jaws are the norm, as are dark eyes. As with hair color, there is substantial variation to all various colors, including ones not found on Earth.</p><p>Names: Humans of the Council Lands use names following the pattern &lt;Given&gt; &lt;Profession&gt;.
